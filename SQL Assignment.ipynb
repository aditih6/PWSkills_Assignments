    "\n",
    "1. DDL – Data Definition Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition:\n",
    "DDL commands are used to define, create, and modify the structure of database objects such as tables, schemas, and indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "Affect the database schema (structure).\n",
    "\n",
    "Changes are automatically committed (cannot be rolled back).\n",
    "\n",
    "Used by database administrators or designers.\n",

    "Common Commands: CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE\n",
    "\n",
    "2. DML – Data Manipulation Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: DML commands are used to manipulate or modify the data stored in database tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "Affect the data inside tables, not the structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Changes can be rolled back (transactional).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Definition: SQL constraints are rules applied to table columns that ensure the accuracy, reliability, and integrity of the data stored in a database.\n",
    "Purpose: To maintain data integrity by preventing invalid or inconsistent data. To enforce business rules directly within the database structure. To ensure relationships between tables remain consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. PRIMARY KEY Constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "Description:  Uniquely identifies each record in a table.\n",

    "Description: Establishes a relationship between two tables.\n",
    "Ensures that the value in one table (child) corresponds to a valid value in another table (parent). Maintains referential integrity.\n",

    "\n",
    "Difference between LIMIT and OFFSET Clauses in SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "In SQL, the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses are used to control the number of rows returned by a query — especially useful when implementing pagination (displaying results page by page).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. LIMIT Clause\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: The LIMIT clause specifies the maximum number of records to return.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. OFFSET Clause\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "The OFFSET clause tells the database to skip a specific number of rows before starting to return results.\n",
