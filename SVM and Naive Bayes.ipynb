    "1.  What is a Support Vector Machine (SVM), and how does it work?\n",
    "A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks (though it’s mostly used for classification).\n",

    "At its core, SVM aims to find the best decision boundary—called a hyperplane—that separates data points of different classes with the maximum possible margin."

    "2. Explain the difference between Hard Margin and Soft Margin SVM.\n",
    "A Hard Margin SVM assumes that the data is perfectly linearly separable — meaning there exists a straight line (or hyperplane) that divides the two classes without any misclassification.\n",

    "It strictly enforces that every data point must be correctly classified and lie outside or on the margin boundaries.\n",

    "Misclassified entirely.\n",
